# Friend-Finder

## What the app does

    This app has a starting array of friend stats to compare against the results of a survey questionnaire with 10 personality questions. 
    When the survey is submitted the app posts a modal dialog of the closest match and adds the new survey instance to the database. 
    With Halloween around the corner, the person images are links to 'scary' wallpaper images, so add your own scary image.

## How to run the app

    From the Home page, click on the Go to Survey button to take the survey. 
    Once all the questions have been answered, click on the Submit button at the bottom and the closest match from the friends database will be displayed.
    
    To see the list of friends, click on the API Friends List link at the bottom of the page. 
    To return to the *Home* page click on the back arrow in your browser.
